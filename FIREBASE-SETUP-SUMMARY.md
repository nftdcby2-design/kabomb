## Changes Summary

### 1. Security Rules
Created proper Firestore security rules that:
- Allow read access to game assets for all users
- Allow write access only for authenticated users
- Provide secure access control for player data

### 2. Admin SDK Solution
Created an Admin SDK version of the import script that:
- Bypasses Firestore security rules
- Uses service account credentials for authentication
- Provides a reliable way to import data without permission issues

### 3. Deployment Scripts
Added scripts and package.json entries to:
- Easily deploy Firestore security rules
- Import asset data using either client or Admin SDK
- Test Firebase configuration

### 4. Documentation
Enhanced documentation with:
- Detailed setup instructions
- Troubleshooting guide for permission issues
- Security best practices

## Resolving Permission Issues

To resolve the "PERMISSION_DENIED" error you encountered:

### Option 1: Use Admin SDK (Recommended)
1. Download service account key from Firebase Console
2. Rename to `serviceAccountKey.json` and place in project root
3. Run `node import-asset-data-admin.js`

### Option 2: Update Security Rules
1. Deploy the provided Firestore rules
2. Run `node import-asset-data.js`

### Option 3: Use npm scripts
1. Deploy rules: `npm run firebase:deploy:rules`
2. Import assets: `npm run firebase:import:assets`

## Testing Firebase Connection

Run `node test-firebase-config.js` to verify the Firebase connection is working correctly.

## Security Considerations

1. Never commit `serviceAccountKey.json` to version control
2. Use restrictive security rules in production
3. Regularly rotate service account keys
4. Monitor Firebase usage and costs
