# Pirate Bomb Game - Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Asset Loading Issues
- **Problem**: Sprite files have non-sequential naming (e.g., 1.png, 10.png, 26.png instead of 1.png, 2.png, 3.png)
- **Solution**: Modified asset loading logic in `game.js` to handle missing files gracefully by using fallback images instead of failing completely

### 2. Class Export Issues
- **Problem**: Multiple game scripts with different class names (`SimplePirateBombGame` vs `PirateBombGame`)
- **Solution**: Ensured `index.html` uses the correct `game.js` file that properly exports the `PirateBombGame` class

### 3. Start Function Issues
- **Problem**: Confusion between `startGame` and `startSimpleGame` functions
- **Solution**: Ensured `game.js` properly exports both functions for compatibility

### 4. Error Handling Improvements
- **Problem**: Poor error handling causing game to crash on asset loading failures
- **Solution**: Added robust error handling with fallback images and timeout protection

### 5. Server Issues
- **Problem**: Port 3000 already in use
- **Solution**: Killed existing processes and restarted server properly

## Key Changes Made

### In `game.js`:
1. Improved asset loading with better error handling
2. Added fallback image creation when assets fail to load
3. Enhanced timeout protection for asset loading
4. Proper class and function exports

### In `index.html`:
1. Removed conflicting `game-simple.js` script
2. Ensured proper loading of `game.js`
3. Improved error handling in `startGame` function

### Testing
Created test files to verify:
1. Asset loading functionality
2. Class availability
3. Game initialization
4. Error handling

## Verification
The game should now:
- Load properly without asset loading errors
- Start successfully with the start button
- Handle missing assets gracefully with fallback images
- Display proper error messages if issues occur
- Work on all modern browsers

## Next Steps
1. Test the game in a browser at http://localhost:3000
2. Click the "Play (PVE)" button to start the game
3. Verify that assets load correctly
4. Check browser console for any remaining errors

If issues persist, check:
- Browser console for specific error messages
- Network tab for failed asset requests
- Ensure all sprite files exist in the correct locations
